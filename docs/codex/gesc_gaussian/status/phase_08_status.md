# Phase 08 Live Status

Last verified: `2026-07-25T17:32:42-07:00`
Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

## Objective

Implement the amended staged Phase 08 v2 workflow, repair and prove the
activation and rotation-aware goal-verification contracts, freeze one selected
profile, and evaluate the declared 120-run empirical design without mutating or
counting historical v1 evidence.

## Verified repository state

- Branch: `feature/gesc-gaussian-robustness-v1`
- HEAD at v2 implementation start:
  `787350e38522856f6463e645714dcc512ad2a5e5`
  (`phase 08: stage validation v2 and harden context recovery`).
- Working tree at v2 implementation start: clean and matched
  `origin/feature/gesc-gaussian-robustness-v1`.
- Plan: `docs/codex/gesc_gaussian/plans/phase_08_plan.md`
- Last checkpoint:
  `docs/codex/gesc_gaussian/checkpoints/phase_08_checkpoint.txt`

## Completed milestones

- Phase 07.5 support and handoff exist.
- Historical v1 executed 81 training runs, exposed its original holdout, and
  stopped safely during the first planned full pass.
- The v1 outcome did not establish robustness acceptance.
- The plan and implementation package now declare the 120-run v2 design:
  10 activation, 30 tuning, 20 selection-blind holdout, 50 additional unique
  validation, and 10 targeted reproducibility repeats.
- Root agent guidance, live-status initialization, compaction recovery,
  milestone checkpointing, bounded-log guidance, and context-bundle support are
  implemented for future phase work.
- Phase 08 Plan and Implement context validators passed after the amendment.
- V2 implementation preflight reran from clean HEAD `787350e`:
  `init_phase_status.sh 08` preserved this nonempty file and
  `validate_phase_context.sh 08 implement` passed.
- Historical v1 is durably closed in
  `docs/codex/gesc_gaussian/validation/phase_08_v1_failure_closeout.md`.
  Its 50 GiB root, representative hashes, 81-run training result, exposed
  12-run holdout failure, and 203/519 partial full pass were inventoried
  read-only. The separate v2 evidence root was absent.
- Historical closeout commit:
  `5a26638e655e136e154dc16fa13a0ee2b3c39726`
  (`phase 08: close historical v1 evidence`).
- The detector-owned `EVENT_CONVERGENCE_CONFIRMED` activation path and
  rotation-aware source-score verification are implemented in the existing
  detector/supervisor owners. The continuous convergence status remains
  diagnostic.
- The v2 orchestrator, five scenario suites, sealed manifest, three-candidate
  selection, clean-freeze enforcement, 20-run holdout early gate, 70-run
  unique gates, Wilson intervals, ten-repeat comparison, and v1 execution
  retirement are implemented in the existing `validate_robustness` owner.

## Current milestone

- Milestone: Phase 08a staged-v2 implementation and pre-runtime regression.
- Implementation complete: `yes`, pending checkpoint and bounded Phase 08a
  commit.
- Next acceptance criterion: commit Phase 08a, then run the retained
  functional/build gates and recorded robust/legacy simulation smokes before
  executing the ten-run activation stage.

## Current problem or blocker

- No Level A blocker is present.
- No Phase 08 v2 Gazebo batch or bag recording has run. Runtime activation
  behavior remains unproven until the prescribed ten-run gate.

## Decisions and rationale

- D-08-01: retire 519 x 3 for future acceptance. It was unnecessarily
  exhaustive for the bounded empirical claim and v1 failed before completing
  it.
- D-08-02: use exactly 120 declared runs with a 70-case unique denominator and
  ten repeats. This preserves all ordered two-source level pairs while
  stratifying the remaining families.
- D-08-03: activation and the new 20-run holdout are early-stop gates. Preserve
  evidence and do not spend later stages after failure.
- D-08-04: retain the existing runner, recorder, analyzer, and
  `validate_robustness` owner. Do not create parallel orchestration or
  validation implementations.
- D-08-05: detector confirmation is the activation owner. A candidate status
  sample alone cannot leave `SEARCH`; confirmed events carry the canonical
  eight-value fill snapshot, with same-timestamp fallback only for historical
  v1 replay.
- D-08-06: goal verification uses the minimum of per-rotation maxima across
  two complete 3-second rotations. Missing first-score evidence waits within
  the existing timeout; an observed invalid score still fails safe.
- D-08-07: the 20 holdout identities are sealed before tuning. The manifest
  excludes historical v1 run paths/hashes and later stages require exact
  scenario hashes plus a clean, unchanged freeze commit/tree.

## Validation checkpoints

- `validate_phase_context.sh 08 plan`:
  `Phase 08 plan context is complete.`
- `validate_phase_context.sh 08 implement`:
  `Phase 08 implement context is complete.`
- `validate_required_docs.sh`:
  `All Phase 00 audit documents exist.`
- `bash -n` on the status initializer, checkpoint, context-bundle, and context
  validator scripts: passed.
- `init_phase_status.sh 08`: preserved the existing nonempty status without
  overwriting it.
- Temporary Git-repository initializer test: created a Phase 09 status with the
  slash-containing branch `feature/status-test`, substituted the plan path,
  preserved it on a second call, and returned exit 2 for invalid phase 11.
- `make_codex_context_bundle.sh ... /tmp/dsim_phase08_context_bundle.txt`:
  passed; the bundle contains `AGENTS.md`, the Phase 08 live status, attempts
  not to repeat, and compaction recovery.
- `checkpoint_phase.sh 08`: wrote the stable Phase 08 checkpoint with plan and
  status hashes, Git state, diff check, changed files, and a live-status
  snapshot.
- `git diff --check`: passed after the staged-plan and context-retention
  additions.
- V2 start Git audit: clean branch at `787350e`, no simulation-ready tag, and
  no active Phase 08/Gazebo/recording process.
- V1 closeout representative SHA-256 inventory: passed; source scenario hashes
  match the frozen v1 snapshot. Current v1 inventory contains 320 sqlite3 bags
  and 320 completeness reports.
- Storage preflight: v1 uses about 50 GiB and the filesystem has 329 GiB free.
- Dependency recheck: `gazebo_msgs/msg/ContactsState` resolves and
  `/opt/ros/humble/lib/libgazebo_ros_bumper.so` exists.
- Selected-package build:
  `3 packages finished` using
  `/tmp/dsim_phase08_v2_m2_harness_build`.
- Focused activation/orchestration regression:
  `91 passed, 1 skipped`; the skip is the explicit opt-in recorded Gazebo E2E.
- Retained functional suite after the final test-harness scheduling correction:
  `188 passed, 2 skipped in 9.49s`. Both skips are explicit environment-gated
  Gazebo recording tests.
- Synthetic supervisor integration repeated three times:
  `5 passed` on each pass.
- V2 scenario dry-runs:
  activation `10/0 unsupported`, training `10/0`, holdout `20/0`,
  validation `50/0`, reproducibility `10/0`. Training expands over three
  candidates in the validator for 30 executions; total declared arithmetic is
  120.
- All ten repeat definitions match their referenced unique scenario
  projection exactly for profile, start, sources, bounds, room, disturbances,
  validation, frozen profile, algorithm, success predicates, and seed.
- Python compile, JSON/YAML/schema parsing, fatal flake8, focused E/W/F
  flake8, and `git diff --check`: passed.
- Phase 08 checkpoint refreshed after the Phase 08a implementation evidence:
  passed.
- No Phase 08 v2 Gazebo run, bag recording, freeze, empirical acceptance gate,
  physical command, or tag has been executed.

## Attempts not to repeat

- Do not resume or overwrite the v1 partial full pass.
- Do not reuse exposed v1 holdouts as v2 holdouts.
- Do not accept the historical C8 tie-break as a v2 selection result.
- Do not run planned v2 commands until their interface and scenario files are
  implemented and tested. This condition is now satisfied for dry-run use;
  runtime still begins only after the Phase 08a commit and recorded smokes.
- Do not infer behavioral success from recording completeness or cleanup.
- Do not rerun the v1 JSON/YAML/SQLite integrity sweep; its exact 548/2242/320
  results and representative hashes are retained in the closeout.

## Remaining work

1. Commit the verified Phase 08a implementation as
   `phase 08a: add staged robustness validation v2`.
2. Run the repository-standard package test baseline and the explicit recorded
   robust/legacy smokes; preserve exact artifacts and outcomes.
3. Create the separate v2 evidence root and execute only the ten-run activation
   stage.
4. Continue to the 30-run sweep only if all activation gates pass.

## Stop conditions

- Stop for any Level A architectural, safety, ownership, cost-sign/unit, or
  unrelated-work contradiction.
- Stop before tuning if any activation case lacks its required state/event.
- Stop after holdout if fewer than 18/20 runs succeed end to end or any required
  evidence/collision/lifecycle gate is invalid.
- Never create the simulation-ready tag unless every amended gate passes.

## Compaction recovery

Before further changes, reread the Phase 08 plan and this file, inspect Git
status and the current diff, identify the next incomplete acceptance criterion,
and continue only from that verified state.
